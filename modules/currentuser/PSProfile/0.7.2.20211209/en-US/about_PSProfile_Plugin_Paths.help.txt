    about_PSProfile_Plugin_Paths

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    An overview of the Plugin Paths concept in PSProfile.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Plugin Paths are stored as an array of strings in the PSProfile
    object property `$PSProfile.PluginPaths`. The paths in `$env:PSModulePath`
    are automatically added for you, so the only paths that need to
    be added here are custom paths unique to your machine.

    These paths are searched for plugins to import during PSProfile load.

COMMANDS
    * `Add-PSProfilePluginPath`
        Adds a new Plugin Path to your PSProfile.

    * `Get-PSProfilePluginPath`
        Gets a Plugin Path or the list of Plugin Paths from
        your PSProfile configuration.

    * `Remove-PSProfilePluginPath`
        Removes a Plugin Path from your PSProfile.
