SHORT DESCRIPTION
    An overview of the Plugins concept in PSProfile.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Plugins are stored as an array of hashtables in the PSProfile
    object property `$PSProfile.Plugins`. A PSProfile Plugin can
    be either a script file or a full module. Each plugin hashtable
    consists of the Plugin *Name* and, if applicable, an ArgumentList
    to pass to the plugin during invocation or import.

    Plugins can be either a simple script or a full module. The plugins
    are searched for among the paths specified in `$PSProfile.PluginPaths`.

    Plugins are imported during PSProfile load.
