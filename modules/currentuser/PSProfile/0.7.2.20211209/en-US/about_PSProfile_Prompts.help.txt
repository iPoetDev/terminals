SHORT DESCRIPTION
    An overview of the Prompts concept in PSProfile.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Prompts are stored as a hashtable in the PSProfile
    object property `$PSProfile.Prompts`. Each prompt is stored with a
    friendly name as the key and the prompt definition as the value.

    The default prompt name is stored in `$PSProfile.Settings.DefaultPrompt`
    and is set as the active prompt once PSProfile is loaded.
