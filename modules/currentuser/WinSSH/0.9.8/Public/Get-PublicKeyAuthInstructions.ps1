    .SYNOPSIS
        This function simply outputs instructions to stdout regarding certain aspects of Public
        Key Authentication.

        This function needs to be updated. Current instructions are incomplete/misleading.

        See .SYNOPSIS

    .NOTES

    .PARAMETER PublicKeyLocation
        This parameter is OPTIONAL.

        This parameter takes a string that represents the full path to an SSH Public Key that the user
        would like instructions for.

    .PARAMETER PrivateKeyLocation
        This parameter is OPTIONAL.

        This parameter takes a string that represents the full path to an SSH Private Key that the user
        would like instructions for.

## WINDOWS TO LINUX PUBLIC KEY AUTH ##

"@

    $Info1 = @"
In order to SSH from this computer (i.e. $env:ComputerName) to a Remote Host WITHOUT the need for a password,
add the content of the RSA Public Key (i.e. $PublicKeyLocationFinal) to '~/.ssh/authorized_keys' on your Remote Linux Host.
Permissions on the ~/.ssh directory should be 700 and permissions on the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file should be 644.
Check permissions with...

    stat -c "%a %n" ~/.ssh
    stat -c "%a %n" ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

...and change permissions with 'chmod'

"@

    $Headers2 = "## WINDOWS TO WINDOWS PUBLIC KEY AUTH ##`n"

    $Info2 = @"
If the Remote Host is a Windows machine running sshd, add the content of the RSA Public Key (i.e. $PublicKeyLocationFinal) to the
C:\Users\<User>\.ssh\authorized_keys file on your Remote Host. Permissions MUST be as follows...

    C:\Users\<User>\.ssh\authorized_keys
        Administrators      = Full Control
        SYSTEM              = Full Control
        NT SERVICE\sshd     = Read, Synchronize

    C:\Users\<User>\.ssh
        NT Service\sshd     = ReadAndExecute, Synchronize

    C:\Users\<User>
        NT Service\sshd     = ReadAndExecute, Synchronize

    NOTE #1: 'Read, Synchronize' translates to:
        'Read permissions'
        'Read attributes'
        'Read extended attributes'
        'List folder / read data'

    NOTE #2: 'ReadAndExecute, Synchronize' translates to:
        'Traverse folder / execute file'
        'Read permissions'
        'Read attributes'
        'Read extended attributes'
        'List folder / read data'

"@

    $ImportantNote1 = "If you need to fix permissions on any of the above on the Windows Remote Host, " +
    "the sshd service on the Remote Host must be restarted!`n"

    $ImportantNote2 = @"
The syntax for logging into a Remote Host with a Local Account available on the Remote Host is...

    ssh -i $PrivateKeyLocationFinal <RemoteHostUserName>@<RemoteHostNameOrFQDNOrIP>

...where $PrivateKeyLocationFinal is a private key file on the client and $PublicKeyLocationFinal is a public
key that has been added to .ssh/authorized_keys on the Remote Windows Host.

"@

    $ImportantNote3 = @"
If you would like to login to a Remote Windows Host using a Domain Account (as opposed to a Local
Account on the Remote Host), the syntax is...

    ssh -i $PrivateKeyLocationFinal -l <UserName>@<FullDomain> <RemoteHostName>.<FullDomain>

...where $PrivateKeyLocationFinal is a private key file on the client and $PublicKeyLocationFinal is a public
key that has been added to .ssh/authorized_keys on the Remote Windows Host.
