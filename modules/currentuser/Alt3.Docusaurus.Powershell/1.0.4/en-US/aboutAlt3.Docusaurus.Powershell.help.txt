SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Awesome documentation for Powershell Modules.

    Live demo at https://docusaurus-powershell.netlify.com/

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The New-DocusaurusHelp cmdlet generates Get-Help documentation in Docusaurus
    compatible format by creating an .mdx file for each command exported by
    the module, then enriching that file with command specific front matter
    variables.

    The cmdlet also creates a docusaurus.powershell.sidebar.js file containing
    a list of all documented commands, for easy integration into the Docusaurus
    website sidebar.
