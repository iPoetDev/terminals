## Registration

Once you have it installed,
you need to register the module as an extension:

Optionally, you can set it as the default vault by also providing the

`Get-Secret`, `Set-Secret`
and all the rest of the
`SecretManagement`
commands!

#### outputType
(Accept: Default,Detailed,TOTP) 

By default, regular credentials are returned as string (for notes) and PSCredential (for credentials) 
Setting this parameter to **Detailed** will always return a hashtable. Effectively, this mean that the URL / Notes parameter of the regular credential will be exposed. 
TOTP code is for Two-factor authentication of compatible websites
